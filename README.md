## Overview

Snake, the game that was popularized in 1998, has countless versions, but I decided to biuld my own using python, and here it is. It was all built using pygame, the python framework

### Screenshot
Here are few screenshots of how my game is looking

**Menu Screen:** when the player runs the game, this is the first thing they see. A menu with the name of the game on and an opition to start playing

**Game:** this is the actual game screen, a simple black screen, with a score system at the top left corner, the snake, and a little red square that represents the food (maybe an apple, or even a tomato if you want). The rules are just like other snake games: if you hit a wall (the window limit) or the snake body itself, you lose the game, and a game over screen shows up

**Pause Menu:** some may say that a pause menu is unnecessary in this case, but I did it anyway. When the player presses *ESC* (the most intuitive key) the pause menu appears. It is a simple screen that gives the player the option to continue the game or quit it

**Game Over Scren:** when the player loses the game, naturally the game over screen shows up. It contains the player's score and the options to start a new game or quit it.
